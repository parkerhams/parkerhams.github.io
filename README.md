# Parker Hamilton's Introduction to Programming Work

Welcome to my profile!

You can view my work in the porjects tab - or, you can click one of the links _here_:

### 'Into the Dragonhead' - a Practice in Branching Narrative!
This program was used to practice brnaching narratives, and user input. User deicison changes the outcomes of the game - such as what weapons or items you pick up, and how you interact with the monster that lurks in the Dungeon of the Dragonhead! Created for my Introduction to Programming course.
- The monster you fight is based on a randomly generated number.
- Pick up items perceivable by the mosnter.
- User input affects how the game unfolds, and the actions you take will change the monster's actions accordingly!

### Madlib
Here is a program I worked on where the user was able to input words and phrases to add them to a story. This way, they are able to change it up and make their own!
- This project was a study in Arrays, and storing and instantiating user input. I worked on thhis for my Intro to Programming Class, but added a few more versions into what it is now.

### Instantiation of Objects
This is a program I made for an assignent in my Intro to programming course where were learning about UML diagrams. In this program, we were supposed to create our own classes and their attributes and execute them in a program. So, I made classes based around Star Wars ships - wherein the user could input their own values for the attributes of teh X-Wing fighter, like give it its own name, firepower, etc. 
- These are pitted up in comparison against the other ships, like the Millennium Falcon or Star Destroyers from the Star Wars movies!
